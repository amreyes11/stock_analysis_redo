# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### In this project, we will edit, or refactor, the solution code to loop through all the data at one time for the given stock market dataset. Then, we will determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. 


## Results
####Successful occurence of the VBA file provided 2017 and 2018 data stock analysis with an elapsed run time for each year. 


## Summary
###There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general.
    Advantage:  Refactoring is a key part of the coding process as it serves as a means of running a more efficient and structured logical code. The coding process is performed in smaller steps. This method can clean up someone else's code making it easier for future users to read.  
    Disadvantage:  It can become cumbersome and possibly discombobulated when trying to pick up code from someone else. If the previous user did not include well thought out notes or messages, then it can make cleaning up code much difficult.  It can also be time consuming increasing the changes of making a mistake and wasting time trying to figure out where to go. 


###There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script.
    Advantage:  Simplying and cleaning up the code will assist in future reads.  Refractoring will assist in a faster, more thorough process by helping to maintain it for future coders and future edits.
    Disadvantage:  Starting from the original to a refractored VBA script was tough to understand and to know where to begin.  Knowing where to start is where I feel I had the most difficulty especially when coders do not understand the entire story or purpose.
